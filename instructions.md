# Product Requirements Document: Hypersub Party Membership Authority Smart Contract

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for a smart contract that serves as an Authority for managing party membership using Hypersub onchain subscriptions. The contract will allow adding and removing members from a party using party cards represented as tokens, leveraging Hypersub's subscription-based system.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of this project includes the development of a Solidity smart contract, testing using Foundry, and deployment scripts for the Hypersub Party Membership Authority. This contract will integrate with Hypersub's onchain subscription functionality.

### 1.3 Definitions

- Hypersub: A blockchain-based subscription management system.
- Onchain Subscription: A subscription service managed entirely on the blockchain through smart contracts.
- Party: A group or organization within the Hypersub ecosystem that members can subscribe to.
- Party Card: A token representing an active subscription to a Hypersub party.
- TokenId: A unique identifier for each Hypersub party subscription token.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Description

The Hypersub Party Membership Authority Smart Contract is a decentralized application (DApp) that manages the membership of parties on the blockchain using Hypersub's onchain subscription system. It allows for the addition and removal of party cards, which represent active subscriptions to a party.

### 2.2 Technical Stack

- Smart Contract Language: Solidity
- Testing Framework: Foundry
- Deployment Tools: Foundry
- Integration: Hypersub onchain subscription system

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Add Party Cards (Subscriptions)

The smart contract shall:

- Allow the addition of new party cards to a party, representing new subscriptions.
- Integrate with Hypersub's subscription system to manage subscription lifecycles.
- Assign a unique tokenId to each new party card/subscription.
- Implement the functionality as demonstrated in the `./src/AddPartyCardsAuthority.sol` example file, adapted for Hypersub subscriptions.

### 3.2 Remove Party Cards (Cancel Subscriptions)

The smart contract shall:

- Implement the reference functionality as demonstrated in the `./src/AddPartyCardsAuthority.sol` example file, adapted for Hypersub subscription cancellation.
- Call the `burn` function of the `./src/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol` contract to remove party cards and cancel subscriptions.
- Allow the removal of party cards from a party, effectively ending the subscription.
- Remove membership based on the provided tokenId, updating the Hypersub subscription status.
- Ensure that only authorized entities can remove party cards and cancel subscriptions.

### 3.3 Subscription Management

The smart contract shall:

- Interface with Hypersub's onchain subscription system to manage subscription states.
- Handle subscription renewals, upgrades, and downgrades as part of the party membership process.
- Provide functions to check subscription status and expiration dates.

[Sections 4-10 remain largely unchanged, with the addition of Hypersub-specific considerations where relevant, such as in security, testing, and integration sections.]
