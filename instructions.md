# Product Requirements Document: Party Membership Authority Smart Contract

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for a smart contract that serves as an Authority for managing party membership. The contract will allow adding and removing members from a party using party cards represented as tokens.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of this project includes the development of a Solidity smart contract, testing using Foundry, and deployment scripts.

### 1.3 Definitions

- Party: A group or organization that members can join or leave.
- Party Card: A token representing membership in a party.
- TokenId: A unique identifier for each party card.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Description

The Party Membership Authority Smart Contract is a decentralized application (DApp) that manages the membership of parties on the blockchain. It allows for the addition and removal of party cards, which represent membership in a party.

### 2.2 Technical Stack

- Smart Contract Language: Solidity
- Testing Framework: Foundry
- Deployment Tools: Foundry

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Add Party Cards

The smart contract shall:

- Allow the addition of new party cards to a party.
- Assign a unique tokenId to each new party card.
- Implement the functionality as demonstrated in the `./src/AddPartyCardsAuthority.sol` example file.

### 3.2 Remove Party Cards

The smart contract shall:

- Implement the reference functionality as demonstrated in the `./src/AddPartyCardsAuthority.sol` example file.
- call the `burn` function of the `./src/PartyGovernanceNFT.sol` contract to remove party cards
- Allow the removal of party cards from a party.
- Remove membership based on the provided tokenId.
- Ensure that only authorized entities can remove party cards.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Security

- Implement access control to ensure only authorized entities can add or remove party cards.
- Use best practices for smart contract security, including protection against common vulnerabilities.

### 4.2 Performance

- Optimize gas usage for all contract functions.
- Ensure efficient scaling for parties with a large number of members.

### 4.3 Compatibility

- Ensure compatibility with the latest stable version of Solidity.
- Design the contract to be compatible with standard ERC token interfaces, if applicable.

## 5. Testing Requirements

### 5.1 Unit Testing

- Develop comprehensive unit tests using Foundry for all contract functions.
- Achieve at least 95% code coverage through unit tests.

### 5.2 Integration Testing

- Perform integration tests to ensure proper interaction between contract functions.
- Test edge cases and potential failure scenarios.

## 6. Deployment Requirements

### 6.1 Deployment Scripts

- Create deployment scripts using Foundry for easy contract deployment.
- Include scripts for deploying to test networks and mainnet.

### 6.2 Documentation

- Provide clear documentation on how to deploy the contract using the provided scripts.
- Include any necessary configuration steps or parameters required for deployment.

## 7. Future Considerations

### 7.1 Upgradability

- Consider implementing an upgradable contract pattern for future improvements.

### 7.2 Governance

- Explore the possibility of implementing on-chain governance for party management decisions.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

The project will be considered complete when:

1. All functional and non-functional requirements are implemented and tested.
2. The smart contract passes all unit and integration tests with the required code coverage.
3. Deployment scripts are created and successfully tested on a test network.
4. Documentation for usage, testing, and deployment is complete and accurate.
